I had an event Friday night and thought that I could finish lab 2 in an hour but I was proven wrong. I know it wasn't very smart of me to wait last minute but I've been extremely busy with my new extracurricular this semester and I still haven't learned to manage my time around them yet. I also thought that lab was partly optional like in 61A but I should've checked that it wasn't.
