This program simulates the motion of N objects in a plane, accounting for the gravitational forces mutually affecting each object as demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation.

The program NBody.java draws an animation of bodies floating around in space tugging on each other with the power of gravity.
