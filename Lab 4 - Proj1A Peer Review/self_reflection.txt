All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: The WrapAround and resize functions don't implement any if clauses and instead uses the length of the list and math to loop and resize. I think if I did that, my code would've been better. 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I am proud of my resize function, even though its nonlinear and inefficient. It took a lot of thought and implemenents what its supposed to clearly and well. 

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: The helper methods, resize and update methods, I felt were very inelegant. I didn't think about how to make these methods efficient or sleek but basically brute-forced them to work. I particularly dislike the nested if statements in these functions. Overall, I disliked how I made my arraydeque extremely over-complicated.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: 

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: I wish I would have known that resizing and looping the ArrayDeque is easier than I thought. 

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would do everything differently. I made my code overly complicated and looking at the code presented in lab, it could have been much slimmer if I thought about the design before I wrote it.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I feel proud that my code is similar to the code from the staff solution.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I feel that my getRecursive method is somewhat inelegeant and could've been implemented better. 

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: I learned about keeping another pointer in the list to make the get method more efficient. 

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: 

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Maybe redo my remove methods and getRecursive methods.

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: I liked it. Maybe delve deeper into why the code was written that way.
